# Pipeline name
Analyse bulk TCR repertoires from Immunoseq

## Workflow description 
Cleanup: 
- Removal of 2 sequences we identified as contamination
- Only sequences with VFamily are kept
- Split into productive and nonproductive

Diversities - separately for productive and nonnproductive
- Gini_coefficient
- Shannon
- total_sequences, unique_sequences
- total_count
- top_sequence
- convergence

Frequencies
- vFamilyName_jFamilyName_cdr3Length - each computed independently
- jGeneName
- vFamilyName_jFamilyName_cdr3Length- each combination
